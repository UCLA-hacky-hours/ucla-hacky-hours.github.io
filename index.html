  - excerpt: '## Who are we

This is a group organized by and for the community in the [UCLA](http://ucla.edu) department of [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](http://eeb.ucla.edu). We have diverse research interests and a range of coding backgrounds, and we are all interested in using computers to better understand the natural world.'

  - excerpt: '## What we do

We organize a collaborative work space where people bring their laptops and work on their own projects, and have the option to turn to others in the room for advise. In the future, we may also try to organize specific presentations/tutorials on general coding principles or broadly applicable packages.'
  - excerpt: '## Schedule 

This quarter (Summer 2018) we meet every **Thursday, from 3-5 pm** in the LaKretz Garden Pavilion room 101. We will post here and via email if these details change. We generally have snacks and coffee available to help stimulate conversation and coding. Please bring a mug, we hate plastic cups!'
