##  Project workflows

--
### Sequence between all stages of a project from conceptualization to completion, which generates files

---

## Two reasons for a standardized project workflow

--

### 1. Research reproducibility `r ji("repeat")`

--
### 2. Easier collaborations `r ji("fist_right")` `r ji("fist_left")`


---

## 1. Research reproducibility `r ji("repeat")`

```{r, echo = F, out.height="200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("borregaard-hart.png")
```

--

> Ecology faces particular challenges in reproducibility because  data  collection  is  often  context  dependent,  and  because  **there  are  few  established  standards  for storing metadata and facilitating study replication**.

--

> The keys to a greater level of reproducibility in ecology are  to establish analytical protocols that are **robust and transparent**, to **faithfully document the analytical process including any failed attempts**, and to ensure that the **storage and acquisition of data is documented and includes the appropriate metadata**.

## 2. Easier collaborations  `r ji("fist_right")` `r ji("fist_left")`

--

### Collaborations without standardized project workflows... 

--
#### Emailing documents back and forth

```
Hi all,

Attached is the script to do the ancestral trait reconstruction 
on beak size. I'm also attaching the data file in case it's
easier for you to read this in. 

```

--

#### "I think you forgot to send me beaklengths10.22.18_latest.csv"

--

#### "I can't find the file you are working on"

## If these problems sound familiar...

### Your life will be improved with a better project workflow

---
class: inverse

## Simple rules for better workflows 

--
### 1. One project, one directory  `r ji("open_file_folder")`  (`r ji("house")`)

--
#### Within this directory, use *relative paths*

--
### 2. Clear organization of data, scripts, output, summaries, figures/tables &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `r ji("zero")` `r ji("right_arrow")` `r ji("one")` `r ji("right_arrow")` `r ji("two")`

--
### 3. Workflow backups `r ji("globe")`

--

*Bonus: Version control*
 

---

## Quick aside

#### Directory = folder `r ji("open_file_folder")` 
  
--
  
#### A file's *path* tells us the string of folders we must go through to find a file `r ji("open_file_folder")` `r ji("right_arrow")` `r ji("open_file_folder")` `r ji("right_arrow")` `r ji("page_with_curl")`

--
```{r, eval = F}
read.csv("~/Desktop/gradschool/ElephantPoopProject/poop_masses.csv")
```

--
```{r, eval = F}
read.csv("~/Desktop/gradschool/ElephantPoopProject/eleph_moods.csv")
```
```{r, eval = F}
write.csv("~/Desktop/gradschool/ElephantPoopProject/poops-by-mood.csv")
```
--

#### Or

```{r, eval = F}
setwd("~/Desktop/gradschool/ElephantPoopProject/")
```
```{r, eval = F}
read.csv("poop_masses.csv")
```
---

## RProjects in RStudio make it easy to have clean workflows
--

### What they do:  

#### 1. Set up a new directory (*or can be established in an existing directory*)  

#### 2. Everything associated with the project can live within this directory  

#### 3. Within the project, only need to use relative paths  

#### 4. Easy to set up with Git for version control
