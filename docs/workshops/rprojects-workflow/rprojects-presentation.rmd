##  Normal project workflow

---

## Two reasons for a standardized project workflow

--

### 1. Research reproducibility `r emo::ji("repeat")`

--
### 2. Easier collaborations `r emo::ji("fist_right")` `r emo::ji("fist_left")`


---

## 1. Research reproducibility `r emo::ji("repeat")`

```{r, echo = F, out.height="200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("borregaard-hart.png")
```

> Ecology faces particular challenges in reproducibility because  data  collection  is  often  context  dependent,  and  because  **there  are  few  established  standards  for storing metadata and facilitating study replication**.

--

> The keys to a greater level of reproducibility in ecology are  to establish analytical protocols that are **robust and transparent**, to **faithfully document the analytical process including any failed attempts**, and to ensure that the **storage and acquisition of data is documented and includes the appropriate metadata**.

### Collaborations without standardized project workflows... 


#### Emailing documents back and forth

```
Hi all,

Attached is the script to do the ancestral trait reconstruction 
on beak size. I'm also attaching the data file in case it's
easier for you to read this in. 

```

--

#### "I can't find the file you are working on"

```{r, eval = F}
setwd("~/Documents/grad school/ElephantPoopProject/poop_masses.csv")
```
